    { "title":"Gothic Basin",
      "description":"This hike is a thrill for backpackers and day hikers alike. While it may look like an easy trek from the moderate elevation gain and length -- it is anything but. The miners who originally constructed it had little time for switchback or nicely graded trails. That said, all who make it to the top will be rewarded with unmatched views.",

    {"title":"Park Butte",
      "description":"A stunning North Cascades alpine hike just south of Mount Baker. Day hike it or backpack here in late summer or fall, when it really shows off the best of autumn foliage. Along with unobstructed panoramic views of Mount Baker, the Twin Sisters, and the rest of the North Cascades, the route to Park Butte offers campsites, wildflower-filled alpine meadows, rushing waterfalls, and a stunning variety of mushroom species.",

    {"title":"Hoh Rainforest Trail",
      "description":"There is something incredibly magical about the Hoh. The huge trees, the cascading moss, the birds and Roosevelt elk, the Olympic Mountains rising above and the broad river valley extending up and downstream, all make this a hike that must be done at least once in a lifetime.",

      "description":"With so many mountain hikes to choose from, many hikers forget about the glories of Washington's coast. There is some incredible coastal hiking all the way up and down the coast, but this little slip of the wild Olympic Coast is a classic.",

    {"title":"Naches Peak Loop",
      "description":"This is a trail to save until August or September. In this short window of time, hikers will rejoice by frolicking along the trail surrounded by fields of wildflowers and soaking in one of the classic views of The Mountain. Because it's a short, flat, loop, this is our pick for taking out-of-towners who may not hike much.",

    {"title":"Burroughs Mountain",
      "description":"Potentially one of the most iconic Mount Rainier hikes, the Burroughs trail will get you up close and personal with the mountain -- so close you feel like you can touch the summit. It's near impossible to choose just one or two essential Mount Rainier hikes, but make this hike is so well-rounded, it makes the cut.",

    {"title":"Harry's Ridge",
      "description":"A classic Mount St. Helens hike, leaving from the Johnston Ridge Observatory. The hillsides are alive with wildflowers at mid-summer, and the view from the end of Harry's Ridge has you looking straight into the mouth of the crate, not to mention views of Spirit Lake, Mount Adams and even Mount Hood on a clear day.",
