    { "title":"Gothic Basin",
      "description":"This hike is a thrill for backpackers and day hikers alike. While it may look like an easy trek from the moderate elevation gain and length -- it is anything but. The miners who originally constructed it had little time for switchback or nicely graded trails. That said, all who make it to the top will be rewarded with unmatched views.",

    {"title":"Naches Peak Loop",
      "description":"This is a trail to save until August or September. In this short window of time, hikers will rejoice by frolicking along the trail surrounded by fields of wildflowers and soaking in one of the classic views of The Mountain. Because it's a short, flat, loop, this is our pick for taking out-of-towners who may not hike much.",

    {"title":"Burroughs Mountain",
      "description":"Potentially one of the most iconic Mount Rainier hikes, the Burroughs trail will get you up close and personal with the mountain -- so close you feel like you can touch the summit.
